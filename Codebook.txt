Project contact person: Amar Dhand, adhand@bwh.harvard.edu

Last Update: June 8, 2025

Project description: This is R code to process data from REDCap form on personal networks for clinical research.

Instrument: ÒPersonal network survey for clinical researchÓ is a form available in the REDCap Shared Library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Associated Files: 

fake_data.csv   - Fake data provided to represent expected output and allow for testing.

process_persnet.R              - Primary code: data processing and visualization of instrument.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Files:

Clean_Data.csv           - Processed statistics and demographic data for both the ego and alters of social networks.

Single_Networks.pdf      - Visualization of social networks; a series of pages featuring networks display alter names and strength of ties for easy visualization of individual networks.

Social_Network_Grid.pdf  - Visualization of social networks; networks are simplified and displayed as a grid of graphs for easy visualization  of the entire data set.
